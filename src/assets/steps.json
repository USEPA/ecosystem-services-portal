In the exposure assessment, the risk assessor determines which plants and animals are or are likely to be exposed to each environmental stressor and to what degree. In the effects assessment, the risk assessor reviews available research on the relationship between exposure level and possible adverse effects on plants and animals.

This includes: whether harmful effects are expected on the plants and animals of concern; relevant qualitative comparisons; and how uncertainties (data gaps and natural variation) might affect the assessment."
