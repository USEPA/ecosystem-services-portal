  <p> Ecosystem goods and services contribute to our well-being and the well-being of our communities in ways that often
    aren't recognized until they are negatively impacted. Integrating ecosystem services assessment tools into your
    process can increase the visibility of these benefits and strengthen your environmental efforts. Some examples of
    ecosystem goods and services include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clean water for drinking, bathing, and recreational uses like fishing</li>
    <li>Fertile, uncontaminated soil for raising crops</li>
    <li>Pollinators that pollinate those crops</li>
    <li>Tree cover that provides cooling shade around homes</li>
  </ul>
